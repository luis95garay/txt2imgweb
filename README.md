# Getting started
To build web applications with react framework, you'll need to have the following dependencies installed:

## Node.js
React applications are built using Node.js, so you'll need to install it on your computer. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

To install Node.js, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org
2. Download the latest version of Node.js suitable for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
4. After the installation is complete, you can verify that Node.js is installed by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:

```
node -v
```

If you see the Node.js version displayed, it means Node.js is successfully installed.

## npm or Yarn
npm (Node Package Manager) is a package manager that comes bundled with Node.js, allowing you to install and manage dependencies for your React projects. Alternatively, you can use Yarn, which is another popular package manager.

To check if npm is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
npm -v
```

If you see the npm version displayed, it means npm is installed.

If you prefer to use Yarn, you can install it globally by running the following command:

```
npm install -g yarn
```

This will install Yarn on your system.
